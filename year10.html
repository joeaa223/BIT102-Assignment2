                    Our Chemistry lessons build a firm foundation in essential content and process skills for our students to achieve academic excellence in 
                    the subject. We aim to allow our students to acquire sufficient knowledge and understanding to be suitably prepared for studies beyond 
                    Cambridge IGCSE.

                    Students will be taught the topic through notes, tutorials and concept maps. Our materials facilitate the understanding and 
                    internalisation of content, and are dedicated to introducing and practising essential exam skills.

                    With our lessons, we hope our students can consolidate and extend their elementary mathematical skills, and use these in the context 
                    of more advanced techniques while further developing their knowledge of mathematical concepts and principles, and use this 
                    knowledge for problem solving.
