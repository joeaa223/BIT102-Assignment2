                <p>Mathematic teachers in this tutorial centre are devoted in teaching the Cambridge International Mathematics (IGCSE). This curriculum 
                    and qualification are implemented to prepare students to utilize the power of mathematics in an increasingly technological world. The 
                    mathematics syllabus here entirely fits the syllabus in an international school, thus leads to a qualification with popular tertiary 
                    education recognition.

                    The Year 7 Math program are implemented to allow students to enforce the fundamental of mathematical skills relevant to further
                    study. We provide advanced materials that are specially curated to give student a competitive edge in all streams. Our teachers cater to 
                    each student’s needs through personal coaching and tutorials on school topics while the pace and flow of each class is dependent on the 
                    abilities of students. This is indicated by different level of difficulty of mathematical questions in each chapter of the curriculum. We 
                    also provide a conducive learning environment accompanied with multi-resources to instill our students’ interest in Math. They are 
                    trained to be competent in interpreting mathematical results and understand their significance. Besides, students are able to appreciate 
                    the global aspect of mathematics, its cultural and historical significance and its role in the actual world.
                    
                    Efforts are taken as well in preparing assessment for the students to assess their level of understanding in mathematics. We are able to 
                    test their ability to understand and apply concepts from all the aspects of mathematics. On the other hand, their capability on applying 
                    mathematical skills and techniques to solve a problem are assessed. From here, they also get to know their capability in drawing logical 
                    conclusions from information and master the significance of mathematical or statistical results.
